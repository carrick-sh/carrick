# Ecosystem conformance and wall-time campaign

## Contract

Reach 100% executed assertion-level ecosystem conformance, then bring successful
non-timeout ecosystem workloads below 2x native-arm64 Docker wall time. Retain
the frozen 2,127-suite scope (438 CPython, 194 Go, 1,492 LTP, 3 Node) while
checking current suite declarations and image identities for drift. A match
that skips assertions, an expected gap, an oracle failure, or a timeout does
not close coverage. Timeouts are correctness failures, not performance ratios.

Use `carrick-conformance-next` and `carrick-embed` for reductions, debugging and
regression. Exact cached-oracle probes and focused property tests expand
confidence where they expose otherwise untested semantics. Docker is a separate,
serial oracle/cache-refresh phase; ordinary reducers use existing local images
and committed oracle data. Runtime fixes and acceptance belong to Codex.

Antigravity receives only independently verifiable mechanical probe/test work
in isolated worktrees. Codex reviews actual diffs, reruns gates, and integrates
accepted changes. No push is authorized.

## Starting evidence (2026-09-04)

Clean main at `05316a669`. The root handoff predates the newer FD-seam progress
ledger and recent carrier-kernel changes; do not resume its obsolete runtime
blockers without reproduction.

- Historical `target/conformance/results.hvf.full.jsonl` contains 2,127 unique
  suites, dated August 30. Its counts are discovery evidence, not current HEAD
  acceptance: CPython 397 match / 16 timeout / 14 crash / 11 regression;
  Go 178 crash / 15 timeout / 1 regression; LTP 1,334 match / 112 regression /
  12 diff / 24 timeout / 10 new; Node 3 regression.
- September 4 smoke receipt has 21 match and 2 timeout (`go-build`,
  `cpython-subprocess`). Neither current correctness nor performance is closed.
- Latest filtered receipt reports `cpython-concurrent_futures` regression,
  including forkserver `BrokenProcessPool` failures and a child segmentation
  fault during extension import. Its 489,833 ms / cached 75,826 ms ratio is
  attached to a failing workload and is not accepted performance evidence.

## Current work

1. Reproduce one forkserver result-pickling failure through a signed embed test
   (`ecosystem_cpython_forkserver_result_pickle`), using only the local CPython
   image. Narrow further based on actual failure; no speculative runtime fix.
2. Antigravity `streamdestmatrix`, conversation
   `8247df96-344c-4b22-b9c2-473d306bc80d`, run `ecosystem-sep04`, isolated at
   `.worktrees/agy-ecosystem-net-sep04` on starting HEAD. Scope is one probe
   source for connected TCP/UNIX sendto and getpeername semantics. No Docker or
   guest runs by worker; Codex owns wiring, oracle qualification and acceptance.
3. After focused closure, refresh the full assertion ledger on one identified
   signed artifact. Verify source HEAD, executable SHA-256/CDHash/LC_UUID,
   entitlement, DOF and run-scoped cleanup. Verify declared images and oracle
   source hashes; deliberately refresh only invalid or new oracle entries.
4. After correctness closure, measure successful non-timeout workloads on a
   quiet host, Carrick and native-arm64 Docker serially, retaining individual
   and ecosystem aggregates plus cold go-build. Cached historic times alone
   cannot establish the final below-2x gate.

## Open acceptance gates

Focused reducer red/green and adjacent regressions; reviewed delegated probe;
unfiltered signed probe gate; full 2,127-suite assertion coverage; current image
and oracle identity; controlled below-2x performance; required host checks;
final signed artifact provenance and scoped cleanup. None is claimed closed by
this campaign initialization.

## Updated operating instructions

The owner broadened delegation to code implementation, with Codex retaining
runtime diagnosis, architecture, diff review, gate reruns and acceptance. Use
isolated Antigravity worktrees. Prefer `carrick trace`, `carrick debug` and saved
core/post-mortem analysis over attaching to running processes. Improve durable
development tools when a demonstrated deficiency blocks this loop. Make logical
commits as changes pass their relevant acceptance gates.

## First reductions and review (in progress)

- The isolated CPython unittest reproduces in 1.83 seconds through signed embed;
  its native-arm64 Docker counterpart passes (1 test, 0.062 seconds, image ID
  `sha256:3126629643b4adcf57ba5cecdb7f9ed257e733b56cd81da70fd5fdbdc1745b30`).
  This pair is diagnosis, not a performance measurement (host test profile and
  different harness overhead). No routine Docker dependency was introduced.
- Existing mmap diagnostics identify a sparse materialization lookup returning
  view VA `0x40002f8000..0x40002fc000` for request VA `0x60010f0000`, selected
  through live IPA `0x9d251bc000`. Host regression
  `semantic_lookup_rejects_foreign_va_alias_at_same_live_ipa` is red before the
  candidate correction and green after. Signed embed then loses the mmap
  refusal but still has a child extension-import SIGSEGV. **Not closed.**
- `CARRICK_FAULT_DEBUG` records thousands of recoverable write faults before
  the useful fault. The first unrecovered-looking read fault is ESR
  `0x92000007`, loader PC `0x8c0000cbc4`, FAR `0x8`, x0=0. Static LLDB
  disassembly of the exact image loader shows `ldr x9, [x0, #8]`; further
  evidence is required before attributing the missing dynamic-loader state.
- The mounted artifact directory stayed empty; no core is available yet.
  Default warning logging reports no core-publication failure. This is an
  open observability question, not evidence that no crash occurred.
- Antigravity's first network probe was reviewed, returned once for partial
  reads/exact errno/destination isolation, cross-built by Codex, and qualified
  twice per libc in a serial Docker-only phase. Cached embed finds a real
  short-sockaddr connected-TCP sendto gap (Linux writes 17 bytes, Carrick EINVAL).
  Worker now owns a narrow runtime fix and expanded argument matrix; its first
  runtime revision was returned for zero-length semantics, host-vs-Linux bounds,
  provider remapping, and a reintroduced hardcoded UDP destination. Not accepted.
- Antigravity `mm-lookup` independently reviews the copied MM candidate in
  `.worktrees/agy-ecosystem-mm-sep04` and expands production-path identity tests;
  it may edit only `crates/carrick-vmm-hvf/src/trap.rs`.

Receipts are currently `/tmp/carrick-ecosystem-sep04-{pickle-host,pickle-mmap,
pickle-bounds,pickle-fixed,pickle-fault,core-warn,va-red,va-green,network,
pickle-oracle}.log`. Signed wrappers run the unsigned negative control and
verify run-scoped cleanup. The initial sandbox-only run failed before any guest
execution; its cleanup could not enumerate processes and is not a valid receipt.
