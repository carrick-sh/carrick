# carrick conformance coverage map

**Goal:** every syscall-ABI invariant that matters is gated by a *carrick-owned*
deterministic test — a `conformance-probes/` probe (line-exact carrick-vs-Linux,
run by `cargo test --test conformance`) or a lib unit test — NOT by re-running
LTP. LTP-in-Docker is the **discovery oracle** (slow, count-based, VM-jitter
flaky, needs a registry); it tells us *where to dig*. A probe nails the specific
behavior down so it can never silently regress.

**The rule:** every gap-fix ships with its owning probe/lib-test. The probe is
the deliverable; the LTP MATCH is just confirmation. When you fix something,
add its row here.

**Headline metric:** # of owned invariant tests, and which curated-MATCH LTP
behaviors are still LTP-only (the backlog below).

Legend: ✅ owned by a probe · 🧪 owned by a lib unit test · ⬜ LTP-only (no
carrick test yet — backlog).

**Currently exposed gaps** (probes whose carrick-vs-Linux diff is non-empty,
listed in `KNOWN_PROBE_GAPS` so the harness stays green while the gap is
tracked here; a probe leaving this list = the gap got fixed):

| Probe | Gap |
|---|---|
| `pauseeintr` | pause()/sigsuspend() wait path doesn't wake on setitimer SIGALRM (the post-d97a47a wait4-path fix doesn't cover pause). |
| `posixtimers` | timer_create/settime/gettime/delete/getoverrun are ENOSYS. |
| `rtsigqueueinfo` | caller-supplied siginfo's `si_value` isn't propagated to the guest handler (synthesised siginfo). |

**Fixed this session** (probes that flipped from gap → MATCH because the
underlying gap got fixed):

| Probe | Fix |
|---|---|
| `schedparam` | Registered sysno 118–121, 125–127 with Linux-conformant constants (proc.rs). |

## Signals & process control

| Invariant | Owned by | Stands in for (LTP) |
|---|---|---|
| rt_sigaction: install/restore, bad addr→EFAULT, bad sigsetsize→EINVAL, SIGKILL/STOP→EINVAL | ✅ `signals` | rt_sigaction01/02/03, sigaction01/02 |
| rt_sigprocmask block/unblock/read; sigpending membership | ✅ `signals` | rt_sigprocmask01/02, sigpending02 |
| rt_sigtimedwait dequeues an already-pending signal | ✅ `signals` | sigtimedwait01 |
| rt_sigtimedwait with timeout=NULL blocks until a waited signal arrives; fills siginfo; consumes without handler delivery | ✅ `sigwaitblock` | sigwait01, sigwaitinfo01, sigtimedwait01, rt_sigtimedwait01 |
| Self-`raise()` of a caught signal runs the handler before returning | ✅ `selfraise` | signal01–06, kill03 |
| SIGCHLD delivered to a parent handler on child exit; reap still works; SIG_IGN auto-reaps | ✅ `sigchld` | (framework heartbeat; wait4) |
| Cross-process signal (child→parent SIGUSR1) runs handler, not default; Linux↔macOS signum xlate | ✅ `xsignal` | tgkill01, tkill01/02, kill09 |
| kill targeting: self / -pgid / 0 broadcasts to current pgrp; kill(bogus,0)→ESRCH; tkill/tgkill arg validation | ✅ `killtarget` | kill02/10/11/12, tkill02, tgkill02/03 |
| Cross-thread signal to a thread blocked in futex/join runs handler | ✅ `xthreadsig` | (Go async-preempt class) |
| Per-thread `sigaltstack` storage (not clobbered across threads) | ✅ `altstacktid` | sigaltstack01 |
| SA_ONSTACK delivery on the alt stack | ✅ `signals`/`altstacktid` | sigaltstack01/02 |
| **SA_RESTART restarts wait4; non-SA_RESTART EINTRs; awaited-child exit never spurious-EINTRs** | ✅ `waitrestart` | (reap blocker — whole tst_test suite) |
| **execve resets caught handlers→SIG_DFL, keeps SIG_IGN, preserves mask + pending; sigaltstack is preserved (empirically, despite man-page wording)** | ✅ `execvereset` + 🧪 `signal::tests::execve_resets_…` | (shell-wrapped tests; pause/kill) |
| **fork: child inherits blocked mask; child pending cleared; parent pending survives** | ✅ `maskfork` | (fork signal semantics) |
| **death-by-signal → wait4 WIFSIGNALED/WTERMSIG; clean exit → WIFEXITED** | ✅ `signalexit` | kill03/06/09 |
| **Pending on unblock: standard coalesces to 1, real-time queues N** | ✅ `pendingunblock` + 🧪 `rt_signals_queue_…` | (RT vs standard delivery) |
| ppoll: blocked signal raised mid-wait does NOT interrupt | ✅ `ppollsig` | ppoll01 |
| **pause(): unblocked signal mid-wait → handler runs, returns -1/EINTR** *(carrick gap exposed: pause() doesn't wake on a setitimer-delivered SIGALRM — TIMEOUT)* | ✅ `pauseeintr` | pause01 |
| **sigsuspend(empty): pending blocked sig delivered, handler runs, returns -1/EINTR, original mask restored, pending consumed** | ✅ `pauseeintr` | sigsuspend01 |
| sigprocmask BLOCK/UNBLOCK round-trip (sighold/sigrelse equivalent) | ✅ `pauseeintr` + `signals` | sighold02, sigrelse01 |
| **rt_sigqueueinfo: queue delivers, handler runs; SA_SIGINFO si_value.sival_int payload reaches the handler (carrick gap exposed: synthesized siginfo, payload lost)** | ✅ `rtsigqueueinfo` | rt_sigqueueinfo01, sigqueue01 |
| Interval timers (SIGALRM/SIGVTALRM/SIGPROF) fire incl. busy-wait + forked child | ✅ `itimer` | setitimer01/02, getitimer01/02, alarm02–07 |
