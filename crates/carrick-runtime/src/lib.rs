//! Carrick runtime — the core that runs an unmodified Linux ELF binary as a
//! native macOS process.
//!
//! # Theory of operation
//!
//! Carrick has **no guest Linux kernel**. A Linux ELF is loaded into a guest
//! address space, executed at EL0 under Apple's Hypervisor.framework (HVF), and
//! every `svc #0` (the AArch64 syscall instruction) traps back to the host. The
//! trapped syscall is then *emulated* — translated to Darwin host primitives
//! (real file descriptors, `kqueue`, `__ulock`, `posix_spawn`, `fork`) — and the
//! result is written back into the guest registers before resuming. To the
//! Linux process it is running on Linux; there is no VM image, no init, no guest
//! ring-0 code. carrick is simultaneously the VMM *and* the kernel the guest
//! thinks it is talking to.
//!
//! This crate is the union of those two roles. The split between them is
//! reflected in the module layout:
//!
//! - **The exec engine** (the leaf crate `carrick-hvf`, re-exported below under
//!   `crate::trap`, `crate::thread`, `crate::io_wait`, …): the HVF trap engine
//!   that owns the vCPUs, fork/exec address-space surgery, the SIMD/FP restore
//!   shim, cross-thread vCPU coordination (the kicker, the fork/page-table
//!   quiesce barriers), the Darwin `kqueue` wrapper, and host-signal capture.
//!   This is the "VMM half".
//! - **The kernel half** (this crate proper): [`dispatch`] — the syscall
//!   dispatcher and its subsystems — plus [`vfs`]/[`rootfs`]/[`overlay`]/
//!   [`fs_backend`] (the filesystem the guest sees), [`namespace`] (UID/GID +
//!   PID namespace emulation), [`container`] (docker-style run state), and the
//!   `/proc` and signal machinery. None of these touch HVF directly; they
//!   answer syscalls.
//! - **The lifecycle** ([`runtime`], [`execute`]): the glue that wires the two
//!   halves together. It loads the image, installs the EL0 trampoline / EL1
//!   vectors / stage-1 page tables, then drives the trap → dispatch → complete
//!   loop until the guest exits. It also owns the fork/clone model
//!   (`libc::fork` for guest processes, one host thread + one HVF vCPU per guest
//!   thread), fault-to-signal translation, the interactive pty bridge
//!   ([`pty_relay`]/[`interactive_supervisor`]), and the namespace supervisor
//!   ([`namespace::supervisor`]). Start reading at [`runtime`].
//!
//! # The leaf-crate re-exports
//!
//! Several subsystems were lifted out of this crate into leaf crates to cut the
//! build-graph fan-out (a ~40k-line monolith re-linking on every edit). They are
//! re-exported below under their *original* `crate::<module>` paths, so every
//! call site across the runtime — and every `carrick_runtime::<module>` path the
//! CLI/engine crates use — is unchanged. When you see `crate::trap::…` or
//! `crate::memory::…` in this crate, the code physically lives in `carrick-hvf`
//! / `carrick-mem` / `carrick-host` / `carrick-abi`; the boundary is a build
//! optimisation, not a semantic one.
//!
//! # Sharp edges (read before touching the lifecycle)
//!
//! - **HVF is not fork-safe.** A VM live in the parent at `libc::fork(2)` makes
//!   the child's `hv_vm_create` return `HV_BUSY`. Every fork in carrick is
//!   therefore choreographed: the namespace supervisor forks *before* any VM
//!   exists, and a guest `fork(2)` from a multithreaded guest first quiesces all
//!   sibling vCPUs, tears the VM down, forks, and rebuilds. See [`runtime`].
//! - **A forked child must `_exit`, never unwind.** It shares the parent's fd
//!   table; dropping an fd-owning value on the way out double-closes an inherited
//!   fd and trips std's IO-safety abort (`SIGABRT`). The lifecycle code branches
//!   on "am I a forked child" on every exit path for exactly this reason.
//! - **One vCPU per guest thread, one process VM.** Stage-2 mappings are shared
//!   across all vCPUs, but stage-1 page-table edits (mmap/mprotect/munmap) and
//!   forks are stop-the-world events coordinated through the quiesce barriers in
//!   `carrick-hvf::fork_quiesce`.

// carrick-runtime is an INTERNAL crate (consumed only by carrick-engine and
// carrick-cli), and its rustdoc is built with `--document-private-items` so the
// Big Theory Statements above and on each module can cross-link the internal
// run-loop / lifecycle items they describe (`run_vcpu_until_exit`,
// `maybe_fork_ns_supervisor`, `SupervisorRole`, `ThreadRuntimeState::handle_fork`,
// …). Those items are deliberately NOT public API; allow the internal doc links
// rather than widen the public surface just to satisfy rustdoc.
